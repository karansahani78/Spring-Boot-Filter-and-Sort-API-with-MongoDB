# Brief Explanation of Approach
### Setting Up the Spring Boot Application:

I started by creating a Spring Boot project and configured it to connect with MongoDB.
Defined the Product model to map to the product documents in MongoDB.
Created a ProductRepository interface extending MongoRepository to interact with the MongoDB collection.
#Service Layer:

-> Developed the ProductService class to handle the core business logic.

-> Implemented methods to filter products by category, price range, and stock availability.

-> Added functionality to sort products based on fields like price, rating, and creation date.

# Controller Layer:

-> Created the ProductController class to expose RESTful endpoints.

-> Implemented an endpoint to fetch products with optional query parameters for filtering and sorting.
# Testing:

-> Wrote unit tests using JUnit 5 to validate the service layer functionality.

->Created test cases to check the correctness of filtering and sorting logic.

# Challenges Faced -->
 ## Complex Filtering and Sorting:

-> Combining different filtering and sorting criteria without conflicts was tricky.

-> Ensuring that the application can handle multiple criteria simultaneously required careful design.
## MongoDB Integration:

-> Setting up a reliable connection to the MongoDB database and handling data types correctly was a challenge.

-> Ensuring smooth interaction with MongoDB for both development and testing phases.
# Managing Test Data:

-> Keeping test data consistent across various test cases was essential for reliable tests.

-> Ensuring that tests are repeatable and not dependent on the state of the database was crucial.

# Documentation and Examples:

-> Providing clear documentation and sample requests to demonstrate the APIâ€™s functionality.

-> Making sure the sample requests and responses accurately showcase what the application can do.

Overall, the project involved setting up a solid Spring Boot application integrated with MongoDB, implementing robust filtering and sorting logic, and validating the functionality through comprehensive testing. The goal was to create a flexible and scalable backend service for managing product data.
